Module 
==========================

A module is a single type of information that Dragonfly stored.
Dragonfly supports a finite number of modules, each one with different keywords that users can use.
There are some fields that are common to every module:

.. list-table::
    :widths:  25 10 10 10 45
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Field name
      - Required
      - Variables
      - Regex
      - Type
    * - counter
      - False
      - False
      - False
      - int

These are the modules that Dragonfly supports at the moment
