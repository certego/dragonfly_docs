Profile Documentation
=======================

Profiles are a way to manage the emulation process and the entire emulation operating system through configuration files

Dragonfly at the moment support two types of emulation engines:
- `Qiling <https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling>`_
- `Speakeasy <https://github.com/fireeye/speakeasy>`_

Unfortunately the two emulators require two different profiles, and even the syntax is quite different.

To write a syntactically correct profile, we remand to the respective documentation:

- `Qiling <https://docs.qiling.io/en/latest/profile/>`_
- `Speakeasy <https://github.com/fireeye/speakeasy/blob/master/doc/configuration.md>`_
